# Continuous Integration (CI) Server

## Project Overview
This project is a minimal **Continuous Integration (CI) Server** that listens to GitHub webhooks, triggers automated builds and tests, and notifies results. It is implemented using **Python (Flask)** and follows standard software engineering best practices.

## Team Members
- **Ahmed** (Project Lead, Repository Setup)
- **Maxim** (Webhook Handling & Server Logic)
- **Annika** (Compilation)
- **Herdi** (Testing)
- **Kim** (CI Notification System)

## **Our Way Of Thinking** 

During this project, the team progressed through stages to establish an effective way of working. Initially, principles and constraints were defined, focusing on task allocation and collaboration. A foundation was built by integrating key practices such as modular design, version control, and task tracking. This framework was then adopted by the team, becoming fully in place as all members consistently followed it. Over time, the workflow proved effective, enabling seamless integration, robust testing, and timely delivery. While this way of working is still active, it may evolve or be retired in future projects based on lessons learned


## Features
- **Webhook Handling:** Listens for `push` and `pull_request` events from GitHub.
- **Compilation & Testing:** Runs necessary build and test commands.
- **CI Notifications:** Sends status updates to GitHub and email notifications.
- **Automated Testing:** Uses `pytest` for test validation.

```

## Setup & Installation
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AhmedESamy/ci_server/
cd ci-server
```

### **2. Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but Recommended)
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Create and set .token file**
The `.token` file will contain the access token needed to authorize updating the commit status on GitHub. 
It should be located in the base folder.
Instructions on creating a token file can be found [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). 
If you're using a fine-grained token, it needs to be given "write" access to "Commit statuses".

NOTE: The token is secret to you. DO NOT PUSH IT. It has been added to the `.gitignore` for this reason.

## Running the CI Server
```sh
bash scripts/start_server.sh
```
This will start the Flask server and listen for webhook events.

## Running Tests
To run the unit tests, execute:
```sh
pytest tests/
```
This will validate the webhook handling, notification system, and CI logic.

## Webhook Configuration
To enable webhook support, configure your GitHub repository:
1. Go to **Repository Settings > Webhooks**.
2. Click **Add Webhook**.
3. Set **Payload URL** to: `http://<server-ip>:5000/webhook`
4. Choose **application/json** as the Content Type.
5. Select **push** and **pull_request** events.
6. Click **Add Webhook**.
